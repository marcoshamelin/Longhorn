    <h1>From the beginning</h1>
    
    <p>A Texas Longhorn (Bos Taurus) is a type of cattle found in parts of Texas.
    <br><br>
    <!-- The <br> tag inserts a single line break.
    The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag. -->
 The Texas Longhorns are direct descendants of the first cattle in the New World. The ancestral cattle were first brought over by Christopher Columbus in 1493 to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
    <br><br>
    Genetic analyses show that the Texas Longhorn originated from an Iberian hybrid of two ancient cattle lineages: "taurine", descending from the domestication of the wild aurochs in the Middle East, and "indicine", descending from the domestication of the aurochs in India, 85% and 15% respectively by proportion.[7] The Texas Longhorns are direct descendants of the first cattle in the New World. The ancestral cattle were first brought over by Christopher Columbus in 1493 to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Between 1493 and 1512, Spanish colonists brought additional cattle in subsequent expeditions.[8] The cattle consisted of three different breeds; Barrenda, Retinto and Grande Pieto.[9] Over the next two centuries the Spanish moved the cattle north, arriving in the area that would become Texas near the end of the 17th century. The cattle escaped or were turned loose on the open range, where they remained mostly feral for the next two centuries. Over several generations, descendants of these cattle evolved high feed- and drought-stress tolerance and other "hardy" characteristics that have gained Longhorns reputation.
    <br><br>
    Early US settlers in Texas obtained feral Mexican cattle from the borderland between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande and mixed them with their own eastern cattle. The result was a tough, rangy animal with long legs and long horns extending up to seven feet. Although this interbreeding was of little consequence to the makeup of a Longhorn, it did alter color. The varieties of color ranged from bluish-grey, and various yellowish hues, to browns, black, ruddy and white, both cleanly bright and dirty-speckled.[12] Portuguese cattle breeds, such as Alentejana and Mertolenga, are the closest relatives of Texas Longhorns.</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy and History</h2>
    <p> They have a four-compartment stomach. The four compartments are: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. As a cow chews, digestive enzymes in its saliva mix with the food.
    <br>  
    They are the only bovine that evolved to live naturally on North America. While the Longhorn has been passed over by the beef industry in favor of European breeds like Hereford and Angus, it still is a valuable source of genetic potential that lies untapped by many beef farmers. This breed is tough, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the climate of the western United States.
    <br>   
    The first cattle to set foot in North America and the only breed of cattle to evolve without human management, the Texas Longhorn can thrive in country where no other breed can live; subsist on weeds, cactus and brush; range days away from water; and stay fit and fertile whether its living in the scorching, parasite-infested tropics or in the arid, subzero winters of Montana.

<h2>Biology</h2>
    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>There horns can extend to over 70 inches (1.8 m) tip to tip for bulls, and up to 100 inches (2.54 m) tip to tip for steers and exceptional cows.</p>

    <img src="Images/CO%20Chardonnay.jpg" alt="place holder" width="700px" height="">
    </div>

    <p>Longhorns are very suttle, gentle, intelligent animals. Traits were genetically fixed, and as a result of survival of the fittest, resulted in ecologically adapted bovine families with extremely good health, fertility, teeth, disease resistance, and soundness of body and limb.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Texas Longhorn cattle eat a wider range of grasses, plants, and weeds than do most other cattle. Texas Longhorn owners are able to use pastures that require less fertilizer and weed killers than owners of other breeds of cattle.
    <br><br>
    They produce a very lean beef (more meat less fat per ounce). Studies at major universities have shown that Texas Longhorn beef is significantly lower in cholesterol than other breeds of beef cattle. A Texas Longhorn's, who was raised on grass without chemicals or supplements, meat is lower in cholesterol than a skinless chicken breast. The Texas Longhorn owner can feel good knowing he is producing a heart healthy product for consumption. Their Meat is very tasty and a pretty bright red colour.</p>
    
    <h3>Climate</h3>
    <p>Texas longhorn cattle can inhabit many types of terrain and withstand virtually all weather conditions. They can thrive in tropical climates and fare just as well in northern Canada’s deep cold winters. They inhabit Arizona’s Sonoran desert and the windswept Great Plains. Texas longhorns are bred in almost every U.S. state and Canadian province.
    <br><br>
    They've survived incredible distances without water, they fend for themselves for food and shelter, they've crossed rivers and survived the desert sun and the cold winter snow. Hunt said the longhorn's adaptability, to hot and cold climates, is another major attribute of the breed.
    <br><br>
    When males fight, they make a warbling, bird-like cry, presumably intended to terrify the opponent.</p>
    
    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <p>
The Texas longhorn is a hybrid breed resulting from a random mixing of Spanish retinto (criollo) stock and English cattle that Anglo-American.
    <br><br>
    A male is usually ready to mate for the first time between two and three years of age. A female alpaca may fully mature (physically and mentally) between 10 and 24 months. It is not advisable to allow a young female to be bred until she is mature, and has reached two-thirds of her mature weight. Over-breeding a young female before conception is possible is a common cause of uterine infections. As the age of maturation varies greatly between individuals, it is usually recommended that novice breeders wait until females are 18 months of age or older before initiating breeding.
    <br><br>
    The gestation period is, on average, 11.5 months, and usually results in a single offspring, or cria. Twins are rare, occurring about once per 1000 deliveries. Cria are generally between 15 and 19 pounds, and are standing 30 to 90 minutes after birth. After a female gives birth, she is generally receptive to breeding again after about two weeks. Crias may be weaned through human intervention at about six months old and 60 pounds, but many breeders prefer to allow the female to decide when to wean her offspring; they can be weaned earlier or later depending on their size and emotional maturity.
    <br><br>   
    They can live on average up to 22 years.</p>

        On September 3, 2016, a young 19 month old Bevo XV was unveiled at a special 100 year anniversary event at the University of Texas at Austin, celebrating 100 years of a live Bevo mascot.<br><br>(yes I want Bevo XV as a pet)</p> </div>

    <h3>Small Ranches</h3>
    
    <p>Being apart of a wide range of cattle, Longhorns are less for eating and more for looks. Although known for being a lean and healthier beef with how expensive and scarce they are to comeboy you are most likely to find them on small ranches being well kept by a rancher who uses them for keeping there acres of grass well kept. On average ranches that have Longhorns only have 1-3 whereas regular cattle is usually in mass numbers for produce reasons. </p>

    <h3>BeVo</h3>
    <p>Bevo is the live mascot of the athletic programs at the University of Texas at Austin. Bevo is a Texas longhorn steer with burnt orange and white coloring from which the university derived its color scheme. The profile of the Longhorn's head and horns gives rise to the school's hand symbol and saying: "Hook 'em Horns". The most recent Bevo, Bevo XV, was introduced to Texas football fans on September 4, 2016.[1] His predecessor, Bevo XIV, died of cancer on October 16, 2015.[2] Bevo XV is owned by Betty and John Baker's Sunrise Ranch in Liberty Hill, Texas; Sunrise Ranch also owned Bevo XV's predecessors Bevo XIII and Bevo XIV.</p>
